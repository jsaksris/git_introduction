This is git repository to introduce the concept of git workflow.
===============================================================

Forking this repository will allow you to have a personal copy of the project in your own repository and can be acheived by clicking "Fork" on the top right.

The general workflow for git is the following:
    
    Forking
    Clone it to your local machine
    Configure git and git remote 
    Branch
    Edit the project
    Commit
    Rebase 
    Push 
    submit Pull-request

This should cover the general workflow.
Many tutorial can be found online with a simple google search.

The file you are seeing here is a markdown file.
It would allow users to create a simple text such as a readme file.
